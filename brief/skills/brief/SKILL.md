description: Create session-owned HTML documents, reports, diagrams, demos and interactive previews requested or accepted by the user. HTML does not authorize executing a plan.

# HTML artifacts

For complex development, design or refactor plans, present the full ordinary plan
in the conversation first, then end with exactly one concise offer to create an
HTML version and wait for the user's choice. Do not repeat the offer for that
plan. Do not offer HTML for pure questions or simple changes, and never generate
it automatically without acceptance. An explicit HTML or HTML-preview request
authorizes generation directly. Choose content and interactions for the user's
actual request, not a prescribed plan or form. Use `write_brief`
in the main session; delegated agents can contribute analysis to their parent,
but cannot create or revise a brief. Plan mode permits this session-owned
document, without permitting project writes or execution.

Choose `kind=document` (the default) for structured documents, reports, diagrams
and optional forms. One template serves these document types. Write only the HTML fragment inside
`<main>`, without `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, scripts, styles, event handlers,
external links or external images. The host supplies semantic theme colors,
fonts, local diagram libraries and interaction code. Do not generate JavaScript
or override the theme in document mode. Use a short title and card summary. After writing, report
the resulting document briefly; do not repeat its full HTML.

Before revising, call `read_brief` without a revision to inspect the current HTML,
then preserve its `kind` and pass its exact `id` and latest `revision` as `expected_revision`. A conflict
requires another read; do not overwrite or retry with a guessed revision. Preserve
the user's previous decisions and content unless the requested change replaces them.

## Interactive previews

Use `kind=preview` when the request needs custom HTML/CSS/JavaScript, such as a
demo, dashboard, filterable checklist, local counters or clickable navigation.
Supply a complete self-contained HTML document. Inline CSS, scripts, event
handlers, DOM updates and in-memory state are supported in this mode; document
mode removes them. Keep the source within 512 KiB, without NUL characters.

Preview runs in an opaque-origin sandbox, with no Node, tool, credential,
filesystem or application form bridge. The wrapper restricts resource loading
and navigation with CSP, and denies popups and downloads. This is not an OS-level
zero-egress guarantee. Do not depend on CDNs, package imports,
external images, fetch, WebSockets or persistent browser storage. Use inline
assets, bounded data images and local JavaScript only. No dependency installation
or permission change is part of generating a preview. A form is optional; local
demo controls do not send conversation messages or approve execution. Use
`ask_user` separately for actual user decisions or missing information.

For a copy button, copy selected text synchronously inside the user's click
handler with the browser's `document.execCommand('copy')` fallback. Do not read
the clipboard or copy automatically. The Async Clipboard API may be unavailable
in the opaque frame. Check the operation's result; on failure, keep the text
selectable for manual copying instead of showing a false success. Never route
authored scripts through a Node or privileged application bridge to copy text.
This browser fallback is platform-dependent; do not claim it has been tested
on the user's platform unless it actually has.

Preview exports retain the same sandbox and network restrictions in an
interactive HTML wrapper. They preserve the original source rather than capture
transient DOM edits or browser state. PNG export is not available for previews.
Structured documents retain their existing HTML and PNG export behavior.

## Document components

- Sections and contents: `<section data-title="Overview">...</section>`; use
  `h1` through `h4` for headings. Missing section headings are supplied from
  `data-title`. A lead paragraph uses `<p class="lead">`.
- Callouts: `<div class="callout info">`, `warn`, `risk` or `ok`.
- Tables: ordinary `table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tr`, `th`, `td` and `caption`.
- Steps: `<ol class="steps">`; file changes: `<ul class="files">` with a
  `code` path and concise explanation in each `li`.
- Status: `<span class="badge new">`, `changed`, `removed` or `risk`.
- Alternatives: `<div class="compare"><div class="option" data-title="A">...
  </div><div class="option" data-title="B">...</div></div>`.
- Details: `<details><summary>Details</summary>...</details>`.
- Diagrams: `<pre class="mermaid">flowchart LR ...</pre>`. Use `flowchart LR`
  for pipelines, `flowchart TD` for hierarchy and decisions, `sequenceDiagram`
  for interactions, `stateDiagram-v2` for lifecycles, and `gantt` for schedules.
  Keep individual diagrams under 30 nodes, quote Unicode labels, and avoid
  experimental types, configuration directives, frontmatter, links and HTML labels.
- Charts: `<pre class="chart">` containing the same closed JSON shape as chat
  charts. Types are `line`, `bar`, `area`, `pie`, `radar`, `candlestick`, `sankey`.
  Data comes from the user's data or a cited source; do not fabricate measurements.
- Formulas: `<span class="math-inline">x^2</span>` for inline TeX and
  `<pre class="math">...</pre>` for an independent formula. Write the TeX source
  without dollar delimiters; the local renderer supplies mathematical layout.

```html
<pre class="chart">{"type":"bar","title":"Sales","data":[{"label":"Jan","value":120},{"label":"Feb","value":150}]}</pre>
```

For line, bar, area, pie and radar, points contain only `label` and numeric `value`.
Candlestick points contain only `label`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, with
valid high/low bounds. Sankey uses `nodes:[{"id":"a","label":"A"}]` and
`links:[{"source":"a","target":"b","value":1}]`, and must be acyclic.
Optional `title` is a string. Do not pass arbitrary ECharts options, callbacks,
colors or fields. Each chart or diagram is limited to 64 KiB. A document body
is limited to 512 KiB after cleaning.

## Questions

Forms are optional. When the requested structured document benefits from collecting
unresolved decisions or information, it may include a `brief-form`. Do not append
one to every document. Use radio choices for one answer,
checkboxes for multiple answers, and a textarea for additional context. Include
only decisions that remain open; preserve confirmed choices when revising.

Use a bounded declaration rather than executable controls. Form and field names
must start with a Latin letter and contain only letters, digits, `_`, `.` or `-`,
up to 64 characters. Use unique form and field names. Each form has at most
32 fieldsets and at most 64 controls per fieldset. Each control's `name` must
match its containing fieldset's `data-name`. A fieldset may carry `data-required`.
Radio and checkbox values and labels are at most 512 bytes; free text is at most
4,096 bytes. Total submitted answers are limited to 16 KiB.

```html
<form class="brief-form" data-name="decisions">
  <fieldset data-name="approach" data-required>
    <legend>Preferred approach</legend>
    <label><input type="radio" name="approach" value="a"> Approach A</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="approach" value="b"> Approach B</label>
  </fieldset>
  <fieldset data-name="note">
    <legend>Additional context</legend><textarea name="note"></textarea>
  </fieldset>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Answers are ordinary user messages referencing the document and version. While
a turn is active, they enter the normal message queue. They do not approve or
start execution, answer another pending question, or change the work mode.
Use `ask_user` separately when the actual plan review requires it.

## Suggested structure

Choose sections according to the user's needs; these are recommendations.

- Development design: goals and conclusion, current state, architecture,
  detailed flow/data design, changes, implementation steps, validation, risks
  and rollback, unresolved decisions.
- PRD: background and goals, users and scenarios, prioritized requirements,
  user flow, nonfunctional requirements, milestones, unresolved decisions.
- Technical review: conclusion, architecture and boundaries, decisions and
  alternatives, risks, remaining questions.
- Incident report: impact, timeline, root cause, response and recovery,
  improvements with owners and dates.
